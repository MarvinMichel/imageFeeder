# ImageFeeder

ImageFeeder is an application build with the [Unsplash API](https://github.com/unsplash/unsplash-js). It shows you a feed of the latest photo's added to Unsplash. You can view the photo's and their details, search for specific photo's trough keywords or just view random pictures. The application uses only vanilla code and no modules or libraries.

## Unsplash API
We use the Unsplash API to get the photo's and search trough their database with keywords. For more information to use the API, check the [documentation](https://unsplash.com/documentation).
